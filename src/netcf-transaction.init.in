### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides: netcf-transaction
# Required-Start: $local_fs
# Default-Start: 2 3 4 5
# Short-Description: save/restore network configuration files
# Description: This script can save the current state of network config,
#              and later revert to that config, or commit the new config
#              (by deleting the snapshot). At boot time, if there are
#              uncommitted changes to the network config, they are
#              reverted (and the discarded changes are archived in
#              @localstatedir@/lib/netcf/network-rollback-*).
